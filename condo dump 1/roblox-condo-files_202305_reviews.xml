    <reviewtitle>nice archive</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>thats a wonderful archive i used to get condo files from an archive by gustas, but its nice that someone else reuploaded the archive, but sadly its probably not going to have any more condo files :(

i prefer condo files over joining public condos because im an introvert

(waiting for this to be updated with more files)</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Some files are missing for some places.</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>I'd love to mess around in the Goat Condo with bots, but they don't function properly and such. Anyway to receive the missing files? Specifically for that condo.</reviewbody>
